                    are caused by covid-19. I have find some of the techologies that are really helping on the tourism industry. The techologies are Virtual tour, Digital payments, E-ticket, Online bookings
                    ,Face detection, these technologies hepled the sector a lot on fighting the virus.

                            Since the begin of the lockdown the tourism industry faced a lot of issues while finding solutions to continue to operate during the pandemic.
                            This has been a challenge to many services in tourism i recommend a solution which is useful. I recommend that the sector 
                            should use Digital payments for all payments including bookings tickets etc. The reason why i recommend this is based on my findings many people prefer to use Digital payments and
                            some of them have used it and find it really helpful.
